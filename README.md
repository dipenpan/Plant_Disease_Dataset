# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting plant leaf diseases using the PlantVillage dataset. By preprocessing images, applying transfer learning models like ResNet50 and VGG16, and enhancing the classification performance, this system provides an efficient tool for farmers and researchers to identify plant diseases.

## Key Features
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 94% accuracy in detecting plant leaf diseases.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Processed over 1,600 images with color space transformations (RGB to HSV), image segmentation, and feature scaling.
- **Transfer Learning**: Integrated ResNet50 and VGG16 models to improve classification performance.
- **Purpose**: Designed to assist farmers and researchers in identifying plant diseases more efficiently.
